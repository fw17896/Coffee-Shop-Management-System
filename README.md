# Coffee-Shop-Management-System
A Java-based Coffee Shop Management System featuring a Graphical User Interface (GUI), robust file handling, and modular object-oriented design.

- Delivery Management
    - Collects recipient name, address, city, and phone number with validation and formatted display.

- File Handling
    - All data (customers, staff, products, inventory) is saved and loaded via serialization, ensuring persistence across sessions.

- Robust Exception Handling
    - Handles all common runtime issues like invalid inputs, missing files, and null pointers.

- Java Swing GUI
    Clean and interactive graphical interface for staff and customer operations using Java Swing.
